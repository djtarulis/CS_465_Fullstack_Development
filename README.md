CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN

Functionality

  How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
  Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  
  - JSON differs from Javascript in a couple ways. To start, JSON is lightweight, simple, and can only be represented in text. JSON is also capable of supporting over 50 different languages while Javascript can only support one. With it's support of so many languages, integrating the frontend and the backend benefits the development process.
  - When developing the SPA for the admin page, the routing built into the Angular app made navigating to different pages more efficient. Creating models for frequently used templates allows for reusable schemas for the UI.

Testing

  Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

  - API testing involves assessing the correctness and security of methods, endpoints, and security measures. The HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are used to perform specific actions. Endpoints are URL locations where API requests can be made. Security involves authentication, authorization, and data encryption to protect users.

Reflection

  How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

  - This course has helped me develop essential skills in architecture design and using frameworks in web applications. Developing with the MEAN stack is widely used and the hands on experience I received during this course is essential in making me a more marketable candidate to employers.
